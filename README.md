# Introduction

This is a prototype called VisChatter for online collaboration on data visualization, available at [this page](https://vischatter.github.io/VisChatter/). For simplicity, it only supports local network (two devices connected to the same network) right now. You can test it by open it in one browser tab, copy the sharing link, paste and open it in another browser tab.

`util.js` contains functions used to call GPT APIs and other helper functions.

`vega.js` contains functions used to render Vega-lite code.

`visconnect-bundle.js` is forked from [VisConnect](https://visconnect.us/). It is a peer-to-peer protocol for synchronizing event among browsers. 

### Analyze

`Analyze/Evaluation` contains all the code and raw data for user study evaluation.

`Analyze/Formative` contains all the code and raw data used for the second formative study.

`Analyze/Test` contains all the code used for comparing the performance between GPT-4-turbo and fine-tuned llama-3-8b.
